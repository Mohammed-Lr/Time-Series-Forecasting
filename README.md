# Time Series Forecasting

A Python notebook demonstrating time series analysis and forecasting techniques using synthetic data.

## Overview

This notebook covers the fundamentals of time series forecasting, including:

- **Synthetic data generation** with trend, seasonality, and noise components
- **Component visualization** to understand underlying patterns
- **Autocorrelation analysis** (ACF/PACF plots)
- **Stationarity testing** using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
- **Forecasting models** implementation and evaluation

## Requirements

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
statsmodels
```

## Usage

Simply open and run the notebook cells sequentially:

```bash
jupyter notebook time_series_forecasting.ipynb
```

## Dataset

The notebook uses synthetically generated monthly data over 5 years with:
- Linear trend (baseline=100, slope=2)
- Seasonal patterns
- Random noise

Perfect for learning and experimentation without needing external data sources.
